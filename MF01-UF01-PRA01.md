## MF01-UF01-PRA01: Create markdown planning 10-weeks

# My 10-Week Plan

## Introduction

This is my **10-week plan** for the upcoming *SCRUM sprints*.
As I am currently in an exploratory phase, I have focused it on learning Java. But I need to go over this document once classes begin to incorporate **React** and **Spring Boot**.


### Key Points:
1. Plan effectively
2. Stay focused
3. Review regularly
4. Be realistic 
5. Be consistent

> "Plans are nothing; planning is everything." - Dwight D. Eisenhower
> "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth." - Michael Gerard "Mike" Tyson 
> "A goal without a plan is just a wish." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Here's a sample code block:
```

let name = "Linus";

alert("Hello, " + name + "!");

```
